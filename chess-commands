chess extension notes:

from smallchesslib.h
Simply include smallchesslib.h, all code is in this one file, no need for linking. All functions and other resources are also documented in this file, so take a look at it to see the library's API. For a typical use you want to focus on the SCL_Game struct and its associated functions starting with SCL_game*.
